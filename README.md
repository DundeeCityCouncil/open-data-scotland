open-data-scotland
==================

The file `scotland-data-portals.csv` contains a list of sites in Scotland
that are partially or wholly focussed on making open data
available. The list only includes sites that collect a number of
datasets, rather than single datasets.

A criterion for inclusion is  that access to data is made available in at least
one of the following modes:

* bulk download in a machine readable format (e.g., CSV, XML)
* via a documented API
* as a SPARQL endpoint
